# Findings
## Group by Year
We have decided to split the flights by year to see how the eligibility has been changed from 2019 to 2023. Here we have summed up the passenegrs of each flight by year and divided by the total number of passengers.

We can see that the proportion of customers not eligibile for any lounge has been increased by 1.57%, as a result of the drop of percentages of all lounge eligibility. The biggest drop happens on Tier 1, where it dropped from 1.80% to 0.96%, nearly by 50%. And the eligibility for Tier 3 being the smallest change: form 18.25% to 18.18% (-0.38%).

## Group By Terminal
We have also decided to split by terminals to see how the eligibilities has changed for each terminals as well.

Here we can see the eligibililies are more skewed towards to Termnal 5 eligibilities due to T5 serving more passengers than T5 (5.46X in 2019, 9.77X i 2023). We can see there is a even more dramatic drop for he Tier 1 elgibility in T3, from 1.55% to 0.41% (-1.14%, $\frac{2}{3}$ of 2019).

Both by Year and by Terminals has shown us that there are less Business traveler travelling with BA overall.

## Group By Continent
We have also decided to split the flights by year and cntinent to see how eligibility are affected by the location of the destination.

In 2019, Africa, Asia (both Far East and SE and Central), Middle East and North America has an mire than 2.5% of passengers eligibility for the Tier 1 lounge, while the Europe and UK has less that 0.6%.

In 2023, Australasia Pacific is the only continent that recorded an increase on all eligibilities, while the rest has recorded a decreased for all tiers. Where Asia has the largest 'defeat', espicially for Tier 1, 3.64% to 1.03% for Far East anf 2.84% to 0.43% for SE and Central Asia.

## Group by number of seats provided (in First and Club)
We as well splitted the flights by aircraft to see how the number of premium seat being offered are affecting the eligibiloities.

We see there is a strong positive correlation between Tier 1 eligibility and the number of First class seat on an aircraft.

Hoever, we are not able to see any strong corellation between the number of Club seats and nay tier eligibilities.
