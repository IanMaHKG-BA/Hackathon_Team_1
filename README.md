# Note
- Jamie @ 31/10: The only NaN's now should be from a lack of flight_info + aircraft type. This affects both columns in flight_info and ones from aircraft type. 
- Ian @ 21/10: There are some NaN's and NaT's on the merged tables, which is caused by flights not exists on flight info
- Todo: Create SH vs LH for all lookup tables!!!
